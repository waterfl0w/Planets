2. Install git (https://git-scm.com/)
3. Open your command-line (on Windows its called CMD or PowerShell)
4. Go to a directory where you want to downland the files to
5. Type `git clone https://github.com/waterfl0w/Planets`
6. Open IntelliJ and it should say something like "Importing" or "Project from existing source", 
7. Select the folder that contains the files that you just downloaded
8. Select "Import project from external model"
9. Just click next until it opens the project in IntelliJ
10. Run the 'Debugger' class. You can do that by clicking on the green-arrow on the left-hand side in that class.
